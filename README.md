## License

This project has two licenses, depending on the usage. The source code is licensed as MIT. This means you can use a piece of the project, such as one of the utility functions, within your own libraries and projects. However; to maintain my own artistic intellectual property, and to avoid rampant commercialization of the artwork, the "art project" (color-wander) as a whole and any output imagery from it (including current and new output images from the existing and/or slightly modified codebases) is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). This means that if you use the code here to produce something that is close in likeness to the color-wander outputs, and then attempt to commercialize it (i.e. selling the work for profit), it will not fall within the fair use of the project licensing, and will be a form of copyright infringement.
